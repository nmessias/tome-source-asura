# Tome

Read web fiction on your e-ink device.

Tome is a web fiction proxy that scrapes content from various sources and presents it in a simplified, e-ink-friendly format optimized for devices like Kindle and Kobo.

## Supported Sources

Sources are plugins installed as npm packages (see [Plugin Index](#plugin-index)). The core repo ships one built-in source:

- **EPUB** - Upload and read your own EPUB files (reference adapter)

Available source plugins:

- [**tome-source-royalroad**](https://github.com/nmessias/tome-source-royalroad) - Royal Road (search, follows, history, toplists, read-later, bookmarks)
- [**tome-source-freewebnovel**](https://github.com/nmessias/tome-source-freewebnovel) - FreeWebNovel (search, local library)

## Plugin Index

Sources and features install as npm packages and load at startup via the `TOME_PLUGINS` environment variable. No scraper code lives in the core repo — see [docs/plugins.md](docs/plugins.md) to write your own.

```bash
bun add tome-source-royalroad
# or, until published to npm:
bun add github:nmessias/tome-source-royalroad

echo 'TOME_PLUGINS=tome-source-royalroad' >> .env
```

Restart the server; the source appears in Settings and under `/read/royalroad/...`.

## Supported Devices

- Kindle (all models with Experimental Browser)
- Kobo (via built-in browser)
- Other e-ink devices with web browsers

## Features

- **E-ink Optimized** - High contrast, large touch targets, no animations
- **Offline-First** - Aggressive caching for low-bandwidth situations
- **Reader Mode** - Paginated chapter view with tap navigation
- **Session Sync** - Uses your source cookies to sync reading progress
- **Background Caching** - Pre-caches your follows and reading lists
- **Basic Auth** - Protect your instance with username/password

## Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime (v1.0+)
- Chromium (installed automatically by Playwright)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nmessias/tome.git
cd tome

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Install Playwright browsers (first time only)
bunx playwright install chromium
```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file:

```bash
# Server port (default: 3000)
PORT=3000

# Basic Auth (required for production)
AUTH_USERNAME=your-username
AUTH_PASSWORD=your-password
```

## Usage

```bash
# Start the server
bun run start

# Development mode (with auto-reload)
bun run dev
```

Access Tome from your e-ink device's browser:
```
http://<your-server-ip>:3000
```

## Setup

1. Navigate to `/setup` on Tome
2. Copy your session cookies from your browser:
   - For Royal Road: `.AspNetCore.Identity.Application`
   - Optional: `cf_clearance` (for Cloudflare)
3. Paste them into the setup form
4. Click "Save Cookies"

Your reading progress will now sync with the source.

## E-ink Tips

- Use **tap zones** (top/bottom 15%) to toggle the UI
- Use **left/right zones** (40% each side) to navigate pages
- Uses **ES5 JavaScript** for maximum device compatibility
- Consider **desktop mode** in your device's browser for better rendering
